Homework on using plotly

The main objective of this assignment was to explore the belly button diversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonise the human navel. 

The first task is to read the samples.json file. 

The next step is to create a horizontal bar chart with dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs. 

Part of this exercise included : 
- Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
- Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
- Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
